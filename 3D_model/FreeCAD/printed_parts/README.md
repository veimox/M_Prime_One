# Printed parts guide

This file is a guide to help you choose and print the 3D printed parts for your M Prime One.

There are 4 groups of parts:

* **basic_parts**. These are the parts that every printer uses. You have to print one or more copies of the `.stl` files for the parts, according to the BOM.
* **electronics_adapters**. Choose one of the adapters based on your electronics board.
* **lcd_adapters**. Choose one of the adapters based on your LCD screen.
* **accessories**. You can print some of the accessories if you want.

These groups contain a directory for each part, where you can find the ready to print `.stl` files, along with the FreeCAD design files to let you modify them. Some of the `.stl`s generated from FreeCAD contain mesh errors, in these cases, choose the fixed version of the object.
